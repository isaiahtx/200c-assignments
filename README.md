My personal solutions to the homework assignments from UCSD's graduate commutative algebra course from Spring '22 taught by [Professor Steven V Sam](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~ssam).
I have am not/was not enrolled in the class, I am simply doing this for my own learning and preparation to take algebraic geometry at UCSD in Fall 2022.

All references to theorems/propositions are from the [course notes](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~ssam/200C/notes-200C.pdf).

The course website can be found [here](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~ssam/200C/).

I have uploaded all homework assignments and the course notes to this repository in case they are taken down from the course page.
